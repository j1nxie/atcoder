# solutions
these are my solutions for various competitive programming / algorithm exercises that i do in my free time,
including atcoder, cses, codeforces exercises. this repository also hosts my old hyperskill projects
from when i took that to learn basic python.

(no, racket being the main language is just because i house htdp projects and the racket files are very large - 
i mainly do competitive programming in c++ and rust.)
