# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

the exercises from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://sarabender.github.io/sicp/html)
and my solutions for them.

## structure

each folder represents one chapter of the book, with each file being a single
exercise and its solution.

the more theoretical ones are in Markdown format, with Racket codeblocks, while
the implementation ones are in Racket code files, with `#!r6rs` specified for
conforming with the [Revised6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme](http://www.r6rs.org)
standard.
